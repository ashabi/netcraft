<p> Now I managed to work from it locally before I committed the files</p>
<p>just one more line to see that I can really do this</p>
<p>These are the steps</p>
<ol>
<li>Edit the file</li>
<li>Save the file(locally)</li>
<li>git checkout gh-pages</li>
<li>git add filename</li>
<li>git commit -m "reason for commiting"
<li>git push</li>
</ol>
