<h1>This is my netcraft page </h1>
<p> Now I managed to work from it locally before I committed the files</p>
<p>just one more line to see that I can really do this</p>
<p>These are the steps</p>
<ol>
<li>git checkout gh-pages</li>
<li>Edit the file</li>
<li>Save the file(locally)</li>
<li>git add filename</li>
<li>git commit -m "reason for commiting"
<li>git push</li>
</ol>
<p>Or you can just do the following command</p>
<ol>
<li>git commit -a index.html</li>
<li>git commit -a -m "message for shorthand"</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember you just need to commit for now to gh-pages</p>
